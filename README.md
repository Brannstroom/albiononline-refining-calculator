This is a web-based resource refining calculator designed to help users determine the potential profit of their resource refining activities.

With this tool, users can enter prices of the resources they have gathered or bought from the market, the value of the refined resource, in addition to various information that will determine the profit they can make from refining those resources.

## Features
* Interface that is simple and easy to use: The calculator has a straightforward interface without all the extra clutter which makes it easy to navigate and use, even for the newest players exploring the world of Albion.
* Settings and values saved: The calculator utilizes local storage to store values inserted and settings changed, allowing users to pick up where they left off in previous sessions.
* Getting prices from API: Users can quickly pull the marketplace prices from the different locations on the two servers to quickly input values and calculate profit.
